            <p>Sylhet in Bangladesh has been hit with heavy flooding that has affected thousands of families. As the flood water recedes, families are returning home to find that their homes, belongings, and lives have been torn apart by this unforgiving natural disaster.
            </p>
            <p>Your donations will also enable them to have access to fresh drinking water. We all understand just how important water is to our health and it is vital that everyone remains suitably hydrated.

            <h1>They need us to survive</h1>
            <p>As homes have been damaged and torn apart, families have nowhere to live but your donations can provide them with a basic shelter that keeps them safe and out of the rain. This will lift their spirits and help them to feel as though they have a home that they can rebuild from.
            </p>
            <p>Earlier in mid-May, Sylhet saw its worst flood in 18 years. Most of the 12 upazilas and towns in the district were inundated and electricity, gas, and water supply were disrupted at that time. Now the floods have hit Sylhet again.
